    <p>I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for software development. My interest lies in the areas of Web Development, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Event-Driven Automation. I have experience developing software in multiple domains at various technology companies throughout Canada. On my spare time I enjoy tinkering with new programming languages, reading, and playing hockey.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Itâ€™s a five year co-op program consisting of alternating four month work and study terms. In Computer Engineering we study everything from electrical systems and hardware design through to software development, networks, and communications. I am an enthusiastic and quick learner who always strives to go beyond expectations. </p>
